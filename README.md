# du
My attempt at unix du command (folder/path size checker), for a course in programming within unix.

Supposedly there was some issue of the threads not exiting properly, I was told by my examinator during a different course, perhaps during some Helgrind synthetic stuff, or perhaps mistook it for someone elses.
I don't know what causes it, as I did not observe it myself.

If you find the issue, let me know.

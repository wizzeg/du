# du
My attempt at unix du command (folder/path size checker), for a course in programming within unix.

Supposedly there was some issue of the threads not exiting properly, I was told by my examinator during a different course, perhaps during some Helgrind synthetic stuff (he claimed up to 8min, but no deadlock), or perhaps mistook it for someone elses.
I don't know what causes it, as I did not observe it myself. I do remember I thought it would've been simpler if I could mark a thread as the main thread, but I was unsure if this was ok in the assignment specifications.
See image.png for my own tests (measuring the school servers /pkg, number of threads on X axis, time in secons on Y axis).

If you find the issue, let me know.
